    "Currently, the thermal models for CUORE can take in input parameters (conductances, capacitances, working temperature for heat sink, etc), run them through a stepwise differential equation solver (Runge-Kutta), and output a pulse. This **generative** model allows us to understand pulse shape characteristics and observe how changes in the parameters affects the pulse shape. However, it is impossible to get back the initial parameters we care about for detector optimization"
